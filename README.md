# WHAT IS IT?
A slim and petite female character model mod for:
* Base races: Human, Night Elf, Draenei, and Blood Elf.
* Allied races: Void Elf, Lightforged Draenei, and Nightborne.

This mod is inspired by Cara Calena's (aka Redaxle) Petite bodies patch, and the continuation of my previous Petite Bodies Mods.

This mod is sponsored by a __Mysterious Patron__.

# KNOWN ISSUE

* distort when zoom out, especially in dungeon and raids. i advice against using any mods when doing serious contents. (this addon should fix it https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/entity-lod)
* seams on limbs, etc. it's a technical issue due to the utilities we used to edit models, not sure i can fix it without resorting rework.
* as of 2022/03/17, new customisation options added to lightforged draenei in 9.2.5 is not supported.
