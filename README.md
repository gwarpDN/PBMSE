# WHAT IS IT?
A slim and petite female character model mod for:
* Base races: Human, Night Elf, Draenei, and Blood Elf.
* Allied races: Void Elf, Lightforged Draenei, and Nightborne.

This mod is inspired by Cara Calena's (aka Redaxle) Petite bodies patch, and the continuation of my previous Petite Bodies Mods.

This mod is sponsored by a __Mysterious Patron__.

# KNOWN ISSUE

* distort when zoom out, especially in dungeon and raids. i advice against using any mods when doing serious contents, but this addon should able to mitigate some of the issue.
* seams on limbs, etc. a tooling problem due to the utilities used to edit models, not sure i can fix it without resorting rework.
* AS OF 2022/03/17, THERE ARE NEW CUSTOMISATIONS ADDED TO LIGHTFORGED DRAENEI THAT NEEDS CUSTOM ART, IT'S NOT READY YET
